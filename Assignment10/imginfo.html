    <p>Mysore Palace, a sprawling three-story, gray granite, Indo-Saracenic building capped by a five-story tower that culminates in a gilded dome in the southern Indian city of Mysuru in Karnataka state. The city is home to a number of palaces, but when people talk of Mysore Palace, they are referring to this palace within a historic fort. Also referred to as the Amba Vilas. the site features cows grazing happily among the lush gardens and twelve Hindu temples that also make up the complex. The site’s history is closely linked to that of the royal family of the former kingdom of Mysore, the Wadiyar dynasty. The family ruled the area from 1399, when they first lived in a palace at Mysore, and the city became the kingdom’s capital in 1799.</p>
